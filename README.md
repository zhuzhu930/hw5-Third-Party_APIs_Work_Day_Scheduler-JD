## Introduction

By leveraging jQuery, CDN fonts like fontawesome and Google fonts, as well as Bootstrap and Moment.js, I was able to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each working hour.
I mainly used instruction materials and goolge things I needed more information to create this little application.

## Features

- Header includes the title, a short paragraph and will load the current time when the user opens up the calender.
- The container includes all the time blocks for each working hour. The design was done via Bootstrap grids, I adjusted the width of the 3 column grids to fit my design.
- In CSS, I mainly used bootstrap css file as a foundation, then I added my own css and twicked the design to my taste.
- In JavaScript, I used moment.js to grab the current time, and the time for each timeblock. Set up function for button listeners and save the input content to local storage and show it onto the page. jQuery selector/elements were used throughout the js file to meet the requirement.

## In conclusion

This homework is fun and I feel I have a better understanding of jQuery, Bootstrap, CDNs, and moment.js now.
